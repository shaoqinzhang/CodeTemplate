# avoid null pointer

put constant or java box type in the left side when using ```equals```

# == and equals

```==``` is refer to two object whether point to the same address.

```equals``` is refer to if the hash value of the two object are equal

# magic number

which is other people might not understand.

# Strings convert to numbers may throw NumberFormatException

# Calender

1 is Sunday, 0 is the January.

recommend to use Calender.DECEMBER

# Serilization

SerialVersionUID must be static, final and long type

private writeObject and readObject

# tricks

HashMap can put null key and null value

HashTable and TreeMap can not put null key and null value

default length of  ArrayList is 0 (```DEFAULT_INITIAL_CAPACITY```)

defailt of HashMap, HashSet and StringBuffer is 16

# [how to define a hashcode](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27581/what-issues-should-be-considered-when-overriding-equals-and-hashcode-in-java)

Whenever a.equals(b), then a.hashCode() must be same as b.hashCode(). Therefor when overriding equals(), hashcode() must be overrode.

When using a hash-based Collection or Map such as HashSet,  or LinkedHashSet, HashMap, Hashtable or WeakHashMap make sure tha in the hashCode() of the key object  never changes.

notice: Map searching objects will compare ```hashcode``` at first, then compare ```equals```

# toUpperCase() toLowerCase()

Locale.ENGLISH

# Integer

recommend to use ```valueof```. -128~127 will return the inner array of IntegerCache



# deep cloning and shallow cloning

implement Cloneable and override clone()

# ```>>>``` and ```>>```

char, byte and short type will convert to int type

```>>>``` is use 0 to put in the left

```java
        byte a = (byte) 0xf3;
        System.out.println(a); //0xfffffff3
        int b = (byte)a >>> 3; //0x1ffffffe
        byte c = (byte) b; //0xfe
        System.out.println(b);//0x1fffffffe
        System.out.println(c);//0xfffffffe
```

$ and | will judge all condition.

# [immutable class](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3162665/immutable-class)

# break label

break the label code block and continue to run other code

# Switch type

char, byte, int,  short, Character, Byte, Short, Integer, enum, String. except for boolean, long, unsigned int

Java 7 support java.lang.String

**wrap type can not be placed behind case**

# Interface and Abstract Class

A class can implements multiple Interfaces 

# protected and default 

default access modifier is more restrictive than the protected access modifier

access-modifier must be less restrictive than the one in parent

protected access modifier is visible to classes in the same package , sub-classes and sub-classes of  different package.

default acess modifier is visible to classes in the same package and sub-classes in the same package

# Interface Default Method  
java8  
if a class implements multiple interface with the same default method. The compiler will throw error because compiler can't figure out which method need to be called.  

if a class extend class and implement interface with then same default method. The compiler will don't throw error, because the compiler will first use parent default method.  


# Functional Interface 
java.util.function

Consumer<T>  
Function<T,R>

# clonable

implements Cloneable  
protected Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException

# finalize

normally it should be overridden to clean-up non-Java resources ie closing a file 
finalize() is never run more than once on any object  
It may take **more than one GC cycle** before the GC determines that a specific object is unreachable. (Java GCs are typically "generational" collectors ...)

 # opton

deal with nullpoint



# assertion

begin with 1.4

Add option to open assertion ```-enableassertions``` or ```-ea```. Close option is ```--disableassertion``` or ```-da```

assertion is closed by default, so do not use assertion in predicate logic.

eg,

+ assert <bool expression>; 

+ assert <bool expression> : <message>;

If you need proper JDK version, you can download them from https://jdk.java.net/18/ and copy them to /usr/lib/jvm/

In my Ubuntu OS , I need below softwares to finish "bash configure"

sudo apt-get install libasound2-dev autoconf libcups2-dev libfontconfig1-dev libx11-dev libxext-dev libxrender-dev libxrandr-dev libxtst-dev libxt-dev
